This is the levels text. Star systems are on the first line. Then it jumps to normal levels.
Each star system is a collection of levels, so don't get confused! Remember to add level markers on end and start of
levels.

Enemy type/enemy preset(if custom, use - to split pos, meaning no preset and custom)/enemy count/time till next/continue

Enemy type:
Type of enemy (enemy1, enemy2, etc.)

Enemy preset:
Formation the type of enemy spawns in. If "-" present, custom pos may be entered. (x-y) Enemy spawned will enter as
normal

Enemy count:
How many enemies remaining before it can move on to the next stage. (Ex; Enemy count 3 - move on when 1 = False, Enemy
    count 0 - move on when 1 = True)
Set this number to negative to disable (relying only on the timer to move on.)

Time till next:
Timer till next wave, doesn't work on last wave. Set to negative to rely only on enemy count. Remember, don't set both
negative bro. Like come on.

Continue:
Value checking if next wave can be spawned without any special conditions. If True, next wave will spawn, if False, waits
until all enemies are dead. Can be set to U for shops, or if when I add the upgrade system and do something different,
make it events. (CURRENT Continue VALUES: C(ontinue), S(top), U(pgrade/event))

False:
Checks if line ran already. Prevents a continuous loop.

Split star systems by bar line, Splits waves/levels by \n, Splits custom enemy preset by -
